# LHC-Meetup
Lets Have Coffee Meetup Project

This project intends to help people to meet together informally to chat about shared hobbies and interests.

If you wanted to find out about something new, what would you do? Google, watch a few Youtube videos, read a book?
If you want to get more social, maybe you could investigate further by using Meetup and meet many people for a scheduled event.

But how about just an informal chat over a coffee with someone who shares your interest, when it's convient for you?

Lets Have Coffee aims to co-ordinate people so they can meet one-on-one in real life for an informal discussion about their shared interest.

# Outcomes Goals

I'm looking to get as much feedback as possible on this project to steer this in the direction where it would be useful to as many people as I can. With this in mind, I aim to make as much of this project open-source as possible, taking an MVP approach with the aim of getting feedback and steering the project in the right way.

Ideas so far for implementation...

-The project will take the form of a mobile app (iOS and Android), with back-end server online for shared data. 
-Use Firebase for back-end users/Event tracking (Using the Frameworks/APIs provided and/or REST API with functions in TS)
-Keep to Best Practises as much as possible (Testing, clean code architectures)
-iOS using Swift
-Cross platform with Angular (I want to learn this!)
-Android using Kotlain

I'll be updating this with links to github repos for the individual projects, but use this as a central repo for documentation for the entire project
